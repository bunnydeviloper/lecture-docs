### **Most important: TEST ONE THING AT A TIME**

- Examine values (simple things: semicolon, brackets, commas... typeof: string, arrays, numbers...)

- Check control flow (if statements, loops, switch statements...)

- Test every assumption and belief, before and after implementation

- Use `debugger`, breakpoints

- Ultilize Chrome Dev Tools, use extensions (Redux state...)

- *Lastly*: search on Google or StackOverflow (keywords, phrases...), look through documentations, ask a friend for help

- > ### **Insanity: Doing the same thing over and over and again and expecting different results.** 

- Modified something each test cases, console.log the result, see if it matches your assumption.

- Take a break, walk around, and sleep on it :smile:

- Find new perspective, talk to someone
(sometime when you talk it out loud, you figure out the solution yourself)

### **Best way to learn something is to teach it**

- If you really don't know where the bug lives, start deleting code, one chunk at a time, hahaha... --> sweeping dust off your home

- Think outside the box

- Don't be discourage, you're learning something new, keep the right mindset and attitude

- Approaching problems in a healthy way

- Learn from your mistakes, review, improve, constructive criticism, prevent repeating same mistake
