#### This can be apply to anything: learning to code, building new habits, build relationship (even with your cat "meow" :smile:), personal branding, work-life-balance...

- Know your goals: concrete, detail, tangible, realistic, break them down into 5-10 actionable steps

- Think big: your goal should be a bit scary too :smile:

- Prioritize (big rock story - Steven Covey), make plans and follow it

- Create good habits, know what does and doesn't work

- Pomodoro method

- 2 week trial period

- Refect, modify, apply, repeat, be consistent

- Try hard and try often, a little bit everyday (tortoise and the hare).

- Learning: the more you know, the more you don't know

- Believe in yourself. Believe in others. Pay it forward.
